        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee to structure and format web pages. It has evolved over time, with new versions adding more features and functionality. HTML5, released in 2014, is the latest version with many new features. HTML is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web and is widely used to create web content.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of web pages. It was first proposed in 1994 as a way to separate the content of a web page from its presentation. It gained popularity with the release of CSS2 in 1998, which introduced many new features for controlling the layout and design of web pages.

          Java is a general-purpose programming language that was first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that it could be used on any operating system without requiring modification. The language was created by a team of developers led by James Gosling, who aimed to create a language that was simple, object-oriented, and familiar to C and C++ programmers.

          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that was first created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Originally called Mocha, then later renamed to LiveScript, it was eventually renamed again to JavaScript in an effort to capitalize on the growing popularity of Java.

          C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was created in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. Stroustrup wanted to add object-oriented programming features to C to make it more flexible and easier to use for complex projects.

          Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. Van Rossum designed Python to be a language that was easy to read, write and understand, with an emphasis on code readability and simplicity. Python's syntax and structure were heavily influenced by other programming languages such as C, Modula-3, and ABC, but it also introduced many new features such as dynamic typing, garbage collection, and support for multiple programming paradigms.
